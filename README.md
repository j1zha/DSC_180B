Project Overview

This project contains two Jupyter Notebook files: DSC180B_Comparison.ipynb and transformer_nvidia.ipynb, which are used for data comparison and running Transformer models, respectively.

Running Guide

1. Run DSC180B_Comparison.ipynb

Follow the steps inside DSC180B_Comparison.ipynb and execute all the cells sequentially to ensure the required data and environment are properly set up.

2. Run transformer_nvidia.ipynb

After successfully executing DSC180B_Comparison.ipynb, proceed to run transformer_nvidia.ipynb for further Transformer-related experiments.

Dependencies

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

Jupyter Notebook

PyTorch

Transformers

Other dependencies can be found in the !pip install commands inside the Notebook files.

Notes

If you encounter any errors during execution, verify your Python version, check whether the required datasets are correctly loaded, and ensure all dependencies are properly installed.
